# LangGraph With Multi-Agents
**Introduction**

As generative AI systems have become increasingly sophisticated, the need to structure their behaviour in modular, coordinated, and state-aware ways has never been more urgent. While LangChain has revolutionised the way developers build applications using large language models (LLMs), it lacked a formal mechanism for structured state transitions and cooperative intelligence among agents - until LangGraph entered the picture.
This repository explores how LangGraph complements LangChain through robust state management and seamless integration of multi-agent systems, unlocking a new class of intelligent, task-oriented applications. This also demonstrates how they can be composed together with a real-world use case of AI Travel & Research Concierge that coordinates across multiple AI agents.


**Prerequisites**

Make sure you have all the API keys. If not, register to respective sites and generate one. Create a .env file and store the keys in it. This code can be used as-is without any modification.
